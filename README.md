## Overview of the Analysis
- We were given the task of determining the number of retiring employees per title, and identifying employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We created some new tables that help identify those employees and find who is eligible.
--------------------------
## Resources
- [Employees that are retiring per position](/Data/retiring_titles.csv)
- [Employees eligible for the mentorship program](/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv)
--------------------------
## Results
- By looking at the Retiring Titles file, you can see that nearly 1/3 of all employees retiring are Senior Engineers and an additional 1/3 are Senior Staff. Also 15% are regular engineers. It is clear that senior positions take the biggest hit and will need to be filled. 
- By looking at the Mentorship Eligibility table, you can see that there are 1549 employees that are eligible for the mentorship. Majority of the employees eligible are engineers and senior staff.

## Summary
- The main question we are trying to find the answer to is how do we prepare for the silver tsunami or employees reaching retirement age. We can use the tables in the dataset to find out the amount of employees that retiring each year and their specific position. This would allow the company to hire internally or externally to fill those positions so they do not get behind on employees. This is very similar to the first table in the report that analyzed the amount of employees retiring per position. We could just take it a step further by breaking it down by age groups to better understand their retirement date.
- The other question we are trying to answer is the employees that are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. By using the tables in the data, we could use it to find out when the employees are going to be eligible so that we have enough mentors for the employees that want to participate. To solve both of these questions, we can use the data tables and take them a step further to make sure the company is prepared.
