## Overview of the Analysis
- We were given the task of determining the number of retiring employees per title, and identifying employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We created some new tables that help identify those employees and find who is eligible.
--------------------------
## Resources
- [Employees that are retiring](/Data/retiring_titles.csv)
- [Employees eligible for the mentorship program](/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv)
--------------------------
## Results
- By looking at the Retiring Titles file, you can see that nearly 1/3 of all employees retiring are Senior Engineers and an additional 1/3 are Senior Staff. Also 15% are regular engineers. It is clear that senior positions take the biggest hit and will need to be filled. 
- By looking at the Mentorship Eligibility table, you can see that there are 1549 employees that are eligible for the mentorship. Majority of the employees eligible are engineers and senior staff.
